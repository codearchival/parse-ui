# Parse-UI

Parse-UI is a simple model-driven UI for Parse.com. With it you can build CRUD apps for Parse.com without code.


## ToDo App

Download or fork the Parse-UI project on GitHub.
Change the Parse.com application key (at the beginning of "parse-ui.js").
Load the index.html page in your browser.


## Addressbook App

In index.html, change the script file "uim-todo.js" to "uim-contacts.js".
Refresh the page in your browser.


## Any other App

That's the beauty of MDA (model driven architecture), because the UI is defined outside of the code, changing the model changes the app.
Make a new ui-model and you will get the app you need without changing any code in the app.


## Dependencies

jQuery and Bootstrap.
